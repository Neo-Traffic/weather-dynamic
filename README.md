#Weather Dynamic

The Weather Dynamic is a web dynamic used to display weather information on Neo-Traffic screens.

It relies on the Neo-Traffic Dynamics API to get its information.

This dynamic is built to integrate tightly with BroadSign as part of the BroadSign Control Player. Fallbacks using URL parameters is possible.

Three display modes are available:Current and weather, 5/3 Days weather forecast, and National weather.

Location is inferred using full adress if playing inside a player, or specific location parameter if using URL parameters.
Pre-filled URL can be generated directly from the Dynamics dashboard.
